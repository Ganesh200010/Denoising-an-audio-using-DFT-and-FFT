# Denoising-an-audio-using-DFT-and-FFT

this might take more time depends on your audio size.please wait until the simulation was done


This repository contains an implementation of Denoising of an audio using DFT an FFT.These two methods are widely used technique in Denoising of audio from the spatial domain to the frequeny domain.
